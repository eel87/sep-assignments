How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
  The Pixel and Screen class data structures allow developers to insert and retrieve objects from a 2D matrix of a set size.

If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
  The developer could use the "at" method within the Screen class to retrieve the object at the specified (x,y) matrix location.

What other real-world data can each structure represent?
  The Pixel class could represent any object with rgb color values and (x, y) coordinates:
    - a chess piece on a game board
    - a character in a maze game
    - a location on a map
  The Screen class could represent any sort of grid:
    - a chess board or maze
    - interactive graph
    - map
