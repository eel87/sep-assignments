What is Spatial Locality and why does it benefit performance?
  When accessing memory, spatial locality refers to the computer taking memory locations from RAM and transferring them to the cache.  This happens when the computer is searching for a piece of data not found in the cache (where the computer looks first).  This is beneficial because it reduces the number of times the computer must read from RAM, which is a longer process than reading from the cache.


Compare the time it takes to create a 10,000 item Array to appending 10,000 items to a Linked List.

  array:        0.000000   0.010000   0.010000 (  0.000601)
  linked list:  1.280000   0.000000   1.280000 (  1.280235)

*Creating an array is faster than creating a linked list.


Compare the time it takes to access the 5000th element of the Array and the 5000th Node in the Linked List.

  array:       0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000008)
  linked list: 0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000269)
  
*It is faster to find the 5000th element in an array than in a linked list.


Compare the time it takes to remove the 5000th element from the Array to removing the 5000th Node in the Linked List. In the Array, the 5001st item becomes the 5000th, and so on.

  array:       0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000020)
  linked list: 0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.001075)
  
*It is faster to delete the 5000th item in an array than in a linked list.
