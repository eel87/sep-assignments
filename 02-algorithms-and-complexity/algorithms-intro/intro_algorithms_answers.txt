Using proper pseudo-code, describe three or more primitive algorithms used in your day-to-day life. Write your answers in a file called intro_algorithms_answers.txt. Here are some ideas:

CALCULATING A TIP:

GET receipt total including tax
COMPUTE tip as: receipt total X .15
COMPUTE total as: tip + receipt total
RETURN total



DETERMINING WHAT TO WEAR:

CREATE new outfit array
GET pants array
GET shirts array
GET shoes array
  
FOR pants
  IF pant is black
    ADD pant to outfit
    break
  END IF
END

FOR shirts
  IF shirt is purple
    ADD shirt to outfit
    break
  END IF
END

FOR shoes
  IF pair is pink
    ADD shoes to outfit
    break
  END IF
END

PRINT outfit



GETTING TO WORK:

SET Path Points to 0

UNTIL Path points == 10
  IF light is green
    INCREMENT path point
  ELSE
    Do not move.
END
