Version one: O(n^2).  This method contains nested loops, causing performance time to increase with every added element to the problem.

Version Two: log(n) (base 2).  Every time the recursive function is called, n is divided by 2.

  "A good rule of thumb is that if you see nested loops, then you use multiplication to work out the notation."
