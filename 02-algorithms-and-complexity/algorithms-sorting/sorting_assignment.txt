Implement quick sort in Ruby.
Research heap sort and implement it in Ruby.
Research bucket sort and implement it in Ruby.
Using Ruby's benchmark module, measure the time it takes for all of the sorting algorithms discussed in this checkpoint to sort a collection of fifty items. Use your output to create a bar chart.
Looking at the bar chart, speculate on why you think some sort algorithms are faster than others and provide rationale as to your thought process.
